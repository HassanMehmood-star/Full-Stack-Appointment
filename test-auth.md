# Authentication Test Guide

## Issue Fixed
The problem was that the dashboard page had hardcoded mock user data that always showed "Fatima" regardless of who logged in.

## Changes Made
1. **Removed hardcoded mock user data** from dashboard page
2. **Added proper authentication** using the `/auth/me` endpoint
3. **Added ProtectedRoute wrapper** for proper authentication protection
4. **Added logout functionality** to the dashboard
5. **Enhanced error handling** for invalid tokens

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd my-nest-app
npm run start:dev
```

### 2. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd appointment-frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Different Users

#### Test User 1 (Hassan - Admin)
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/auth/login
2. Login with Hassan's credentials (admin)
3. Verify you see Hassan's name and admin role in the dashboard
4. Check that the dashboard shows admin-specific content

#### Test User 2 (Fatima - Patient)
1. Open a new incognito/private browser window
2. Go to http://localhost:3000/auth/login
3. Login with Fatima's credentials (patient)
4. Verify you see Fatima's name and patient role in the dashboard
5. Check that the dashboard shows patient-specific content

#### Test User 3 (Any other user)
1. Open another incognito/private browser window
2. Go to http://localhost:3000/auth/login
3. Login with any other user's credentials
4. Verify you see the correct user's name and role

### 4. Test Logout
1. Click the "Logout" button in the sidebar
2. Verify you're redirected to the login page
3. Try to access the dashboard directly - you should be redirected to login

### 5. Test Token Expiry
1. Login with any user
2. Manually delete the token from browser localStorage
3. Refresh the page
4. Verify you're redirected to the login page

## Expected Behavior
- Each user should see their own name and role in the dashboard
- The dashboard content should be role-specific
- Logout should clear all authentication data
- Invalid/expired tokens should redirect to login
- Direct access to dashboard without authentication should redirect to login

## Files Modified
- `appointment-frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Fixed authentication logic
- Added proper user data fetching from API
- Added ProtectedRoute wrapper
- Added logout functionality
